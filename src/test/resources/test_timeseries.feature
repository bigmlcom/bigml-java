Feature: TimeSeries REST api

    Scenario Outline: Successfully creating forecasts from a dataset:
        Given I provision a dataset from "<data>" file
        And I create a time series from a dataset
        And I wait until the time series is ready less than <time_1> secs
        And I update the time series name to "<time_series_name>"
        When I wait until the time series is ready less than <time_2> secs
        Then the time series name is "<time_series_name>"
        And I create a forecast for "<input_data>"
        Then the forecasts are "<forecast_points>"

        Examples:
        | data             | time_1  | time_2 | time_series_name | input_data | forecast_points   |
        | data/grades.csv | 200     | 500 | my new time series name | {"000005": {"horizon": 5}}   | {"000005": [{"point_forecast": [73.96192, 74.04106, 74.12029, 74.1996, 74.27899], "model": "M,M,N"}]}    |
