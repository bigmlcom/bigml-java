Feature: Inspect the information of a local model
  In order to inspect the information
  I need to create a model and a dataset first

  Scenario Outline: Successfully creating a model and translate the tree model into a set of IF-THEN rules:
    Given I create a data source uploading a "<data>" file
    And I wait until the source is ready less than <time_1> secs
    And I create a dataset
    And I wait until the dataset is ready less than <time_2> secs
    And I create a model
    And I wait until the model is ready less than <time_3> secs
    And I create a local model for inspection
    And I translate the tree into IF_THEN rules
    Then I check the output is like "<expected_file>" expected file

    Examples:
    | data                   | time_1   | time_2 | time_3 | expected_file                                  |
