Feature: Ensembles REST api

    Scenario Outline: Successfully creating a prediction from an ensemble:
        Given I provision a dataset from "<data>" file
        And I create an ensemble of <number_of_models> models
        And I wait until the ensemble is ready less than <time_1> secs
        When I create a prediction with ensemble for "<data_input>"
        And I wait until the prediction is ready less than <time_2> secs
        Then the prediction for "<objective>" is "<prediction>"

				Examples:
        | data	| time_1  | time_2 | number_of_models | data_input    | objective | prediction  |
        | data/iris.csv |  100	| 100	| 5	| {"petal width": 0.5} | 000004    | Iris-versicolor |
        | data/iris_sp_chars.csv | 100 | 100 | 5 | {"p√©tal&width\u0000": 0.5} | 000004 | Iris-versicolor |
